# React, MST, and InteractJS code challenge

## Mmmm, what's that?

Hi!! This is a code challenge based on React with Mobx State Tree as a app state management and InteractJS as a third party library for dragging, moving, and other interactions with the DOM.

## How can I try it?
To play with this app you just need to install de dependencies (`npm install`) and run `npm start`. You will see a working area with a simple draggable box that you can change the color to.

## And what else can I do?
In addition, you can add new boxes to the working area, move them, delete them, change the color globally, go back to previous states, recover previously undone states, and finally you can save the current state of your working area to recover it in the case that you refresh the browser.
